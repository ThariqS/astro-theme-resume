My current goal is to spend as much time in my <PostLink slug="clay-and-light">higher self</PostLink> as possible.

But I struggle with how to achieve this.

In almost every avenue of life, we have systematic tools for achieving outcomes, what I often think of as 'technology'. For example, **social technologies** include things like democracy, contracts and corporations that help define our social contract and encourage pro-social behavior.

Reading <PostLink href="https://www.amazon.com/Disciplining-Soul-Breaking-Two-Desires/dp/0946621438" title="Disciplining the Soul" description="By Imam Al-Ghazali. A treatise on self-discipline and breaking the two desires.">Ghazali's _Disciplining the Soul_</PostLink> was the first time I truly internalized the idea of _spiritual technologies_. Systematized ways of improving ones character and soul.

He lists 4 in particular: solitude, silence, hunger and sleeplessness.

<BookQuote title='Disciplining the Soul' author='Imam Al-Ghazali'>
	Although the actual methods followed in self-discipline varied considerably, most of the early
	ascetics stressed four practices: <mark>'solitude, silence, hunger, and sleeplessness.'</mark>{' '}
</BookQuote>

Through most of my life, I have thought of these as problems to be solved. Why be hungry, when you could eat? Why stay awake tired, when you could sleep?

The answer is _because_, it does not make sense. It is not for your lower self. It is in search of the euphoria of the higher self.

I think of these tools, the only ones I feel comfortable wielding are solitude and silence. I have rarely achieved the euphoria of fasting or of sleeplessness.

But I love to try new technology.
