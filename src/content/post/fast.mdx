<p className='text-sm italic'>&nbsp;(slight spoiler alert for [Siddhartha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)))</p>

<PoemQuote title='' poet='Hermann Hesse'>
	"But if you don't mind me asking: being without possessions, what would you like to give?"
	<br />
	"Everyone gives what he has. The warrior gives strength, the merchant gives merchandise, the
	teacher teachings, the farmer rice, the fisher fish."
	<br />
	"Yes indeed. And what is it now what you've got to give? What is it that you've learned, what
	you're able to do?"
	<br />
	"I can think. I can wait. I can fast."
	<br />
	"That's everything?"
	<br />
	"I believe, that's everything!"
	<br />
	"And what's the use of that? For example, the fasting—what is it good for?"
	<br />
	"It is very good, sir. When a person has nothing to eat, fasting is the smartest thing he could
	do. When, for example, Siddhartha hadn't learned to fast, he would have to accept any kind of
	service before this day is up, whether it may be with you or wherever, because hunger would force
	him to do so. But like this, Siddhartha can wait calmly, he knows no impatience, he knows no
	emergency, for a long time he can allow hunger to besiege him and can laugh about it.
	<br />
	This, sir, is what fasting is good for."

There is likely only one way to get what you want: to want less.

Not wanting is the most powerful thing in the world. It removes all power people can have over you, and there is nothing that people want more than power over you.
