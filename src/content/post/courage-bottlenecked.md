One of the True things I believe is that we are all courage bottle necked.

Almost everyone has something they're holding back, they're ignoring, they're not doing. This thing is always incredibly legible, it is not a secret.

You could ask your friend and they might know, or you could talk to them vulnerably and you would say it yourself out loud.

But this thing is almost always painful and difficult and has large implications for who you are or your life. You will want to reason your way out of it, in fact being smart almost never helps with courage. It mostly makes you more cowardly because you can think of a smart reason why you should not do the difficult thing.

I think some people might have some modicum more courage than others, but in my experience it is not true that they have it unending reserves. Usually making one hard decision makes the subsequent ones much easier.

The best thing to do then is to somehow gather your courage as well as you can. I don't think there is a secret to this, but let me know if you find one.
