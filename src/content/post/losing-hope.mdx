The interpretation of a sacred text is true<br />
if it stirs you to hope, activity, and awe;<br />
and if it makes you slacken your service,<br />
know the real truth to be this:<br />
it's a distortion of the sense of the saying,<br />
not a true interpretation.

This saying has come down to inspire you to serve—<br />
that God may take the hands of those who have lost hope.

Ask the meaning of the Qur'an from the Qur'an alone,<br />
and from that one who has set fire to his idle fancy<br />
and burned it away,<br />
and has become a sacrifice to the Qur'an,<br />
bowing low in humbleness,<br />
so that the Qur'an has become the essence of his spirit.

If an essential oil that has utterly devoted itself to the rose,<br />
you can smell either that oil or the rose, as you please.

  title="Siddhartha"
  poet="Hermann Hesse"
>
His father was to be admired,<br />
quiet and noble were his manners,<br />
pure his life, wise his words,<br />
delicate and noble thoughts lived behind its brow<br />
—but even he, who knew so much,<br />
did he live in blissfulness,<br />
did he have peace,<br />
was he not also just a searching man, a thirsty man?

Did he not, again and again,<br />
have to drink from holy sources, as a thirsty man,<br />
from the offerings, from the books,<br />
from the disputes of the Brahmans?<br />
Why did he, the irreproachable one,<br />
have to wash off sins every day,<br />
strive for a cleansing every day, over and over every day?<br />
Was not Atman in him,<br />
did not the pristine source spring from his heart?<br />
It had to be found, the pristine source in one's own self,<br />
it had to be possessed!<br />
Everything else was searching, was a detour, was getting lost.

I met many people in SF, myself included sometimes, who are losing hope or have lost hope in some greater spiritual belief.
