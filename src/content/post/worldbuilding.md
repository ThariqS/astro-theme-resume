This AI Worldbuilding prototype was part of a number of AI x D&D prototypes we experimented with at Multiverse in 2022.

The goal was to create a tool that could understand a GMs worldbuilding notes and help them generate more plotlines and flesh out their world.

The key was a suggestive UX that surfaced interesting ideas that the user could then latch on to and expand on.
