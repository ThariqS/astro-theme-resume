We're told in Islam-

> Be in this world as a stranger, or a traveler.

A traveler takes nothing. Leaves only footprints. Doesn't get attached to the inns along the way. Because it's more likely that the world will change you, than you will change the world.

At times this feels hard, even cruel. Why abdicate your responsibility to the world?

> It began as something strange, and it will return to being strange — so glad tidings to the strangers.

I used to think this was a warning about the difficulty of faith. But now I read it differently.

Being strange is not a curse. It is the natural state of anything true.

There are things that can be good, true and make an impact, but they start small, and strange.

Strangeness is a sign that your <PostLink slug="clay-and-light">higher self</PostLink> is driving.

> The matter of a believer is strange, everything is good for them.

I think the answer to my question is somewhere in here.

The traveler isn't passive. They are just unattached to outcomes. They do the work in silence, plant the seeds, and keep moving.

Anything can be good for you. Failure can be good for you. Wild success can be good for you. Losing it all can be good for you.

Building is good, but you must be ready to leave it all behind.

_Glad tidings to the strangers._
